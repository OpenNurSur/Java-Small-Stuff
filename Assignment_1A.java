// 1) Was your program written efficiently? Why or why not? If it wasnâ€™t efficient, can you modify it to use fewer lines of code for the calculations?

//Ans : At first, my program was not written efficiently due to the use of repeated lines, so what I did was using a loop instead which allowed the program to first run more efficiently but also saved a lot of space(lines)
//Ans2 : To keep things simple and efficient I have used a one line code to round up to results to two decimal places.

//2) Why are the outputs in the sample printout all rounded off? How do the different data types affect the accuracy of the answers? Research or test out changes that would get more accurate quotients. Can you round your answers to two decimal places?

//Ans : The output are printed all roudned off because we're using "int", if as an example I want to get decimal results I could just use "double" instead.
